# Vuejs Uploader

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/charliekassel/vuejs-uploader.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Multipart uploader Vue component.

This uploader will optionally upload files in multipart chunks.
This get's around max upload sizes allowing you to upload large files.

If prop `multiple` is true a file list is rendered on selecting files otherwise file upload will begin on selection.

Drag is supported and when files are dragged over the uploader the class `vuejs-uploader--dragged` is added to the root element.

### Remaining upload parts

For resumable uploads we need to know what parts have already been uploaded so we don't bother re uploading them.
This component makes use of a response property that returns an array of parts remaining that still need to be uploaded.
If this property is in the response it will remove any parts in the queue that are not in that array.
To make use of this property it expects to be formatted as `meta.remainingParts`.

## Install

```bash
npm install vuejs-uploader
```

## Usage

Basic
```html
<uploader end-point="http://localhost:5000"></uploader>
```

Multipart upload, with custom Browse button using `slot` api
